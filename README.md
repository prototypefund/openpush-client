This is a work in progress and unfinished implementation of the [openPush protocol](https://bubu1.eu/openpush/).


Pushserver api client classes are generated form [this](https://gitlab.com/Bubu/pushserver/blob/master/openapi.yml) file. Model and Api classes can be easily updated with `./update_apiclient.sh`, the top-level ApiClient and JSON classes are generated as well but contain some manual changes.
